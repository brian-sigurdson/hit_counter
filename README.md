This repo is just a place to practice ci/cd with a simple app.  

The code was forked from https://github.com/efoda/hit_counter, as the repo was featured in an exercise for the Packt Packt Publishing text The Docker Workshop.  

The code originates from an example on the Docker Documentation at this link:
